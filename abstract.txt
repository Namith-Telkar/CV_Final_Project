The corneal epithelium, as the outermost layer of the cornea, plays a critical role in maintaining corneal transparency and providing a protective barrier. 
In this project, we present a novel approach for automating the classification of corneal epithelium tissue images into homeostatic and non-homeostatic states, 
based on cell count and structural integrity. Using images generated by CompuCell3D simulations, we train a U-Net model for image segmentation and extract 
features related to width and continuity from segmented images. These features serve as the basis for unsupervised classification using K-Means clustering. 
Experimentation with various methods, including Autoencoders and U-Nets, demonstrates promising results, with the trained U-Net model achieving an accuracy 
of approximately 98 % in image segmentation with a mean IOU of 94.88%. K-Means clustering reveals inherent patterns in the dataset and suggests an optimal 
number of clusters for effective classification. This research contributes to streamlining the analysis of corneal epithelium images, reducing manual labor, 
and providing valuable insights into tissue homeostasis.
